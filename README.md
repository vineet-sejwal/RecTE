The python snippets given here find the similarities between user/items for the resstaurents and hotels domains using topic embedding generated with the help of topic modeling and word embedding. Based-on the topic embedding similarities, we predict the ratings. The whole program is written in Django webframework, which can be downloaded from, https://www.djangoproject.com/. To store the data, we have used MySQL database. Django uses Object-relational mapping (ORM) concept which provides an easy query and database setup.
